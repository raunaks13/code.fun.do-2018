MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM

IF YOU LIVE IN (OR IF YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 10.
This agreement describes your rights and the conditions upon which you may use the Windows software.
You should review the entire agreement, including any supplemental license terms that accompany the software and any linked terms, because all of the terms are important and together create this agreement that applies to you.
If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the software or its features.
You may contact the device manufacturer or installer, or your retailer if you purchased the software directly, to determine its return policy and return the software or device for a refund or credit under that policy.
a.      Applicability.
(i)      Some Windows apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services Agreement at (aka.ms/msa).
(ii)     Microsoft, the manufacturer or installer may include additional apps, which will be subject to separate license terms and privacy policies.
(iii)     The software includes Adobe Flash Player that is licensed under terms from Adobe Systems Incorporated at (aka.ms/adobeflash).
License terms, notices and acknowledgements, if any, for the third party programs can be viewed at (aka.ms/thirdpartynotices).
(v)     To the extent included with Windows, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote are licensed for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you have commercial use rights under a separate agreement.
The software is licensed, not sold.
In this agreement, “device” means a hardware system (whether physical or virtual) with an internal storage device capable of running the software.
A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a device.
Hardware or software you use to multiplex or pool connections, or reduce the number of devices or users that access or use the software, does not reduce the number of licenses you need.
(iv)    Use in a virtualized environment.
This license allows you to install only one instance of the software for use on one device, whether that device is physical or virtual.
No more than once every 90 days, you may designate a single user who physically uses the licensed device as the licensed user.
The licensed user may access the licensed device from another device using remote access technologies.
You may use remote assistance technologies to share an active session without obtaining any additional licenses for the software.
Remote assistance allows one user to connect directly to another user’s computer, usually to correct problems.
Privacy; Consent to Use of Data.
By accepting this agreement and using the software you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement (aka.ms/privacy), and as may be described in the user interface associated with the software features.
